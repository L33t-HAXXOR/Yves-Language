### Tips to get your language accepted faster
- Make sure your file is valid JSON. Use a website like https://jsonlint.com/ to check your files for errors before submitting
- Describe your changes, If we know what you did we can review it faster!
- Be on the discord! You don't have to pay attention to github if we can just talk to you directly :)
